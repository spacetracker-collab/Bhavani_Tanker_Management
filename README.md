**Bhavani_Tanker_Management**


The user experience of a Fleet Management (Tanker Management) web application that was developed using QooxDoo for one of the Worlds Top Truck Manufacturers. The backend used PostGIS and Shp (Shape Files).  Qooxdoo was a Python framework initially. Now it is based on Javascript/TypeScript/es6. The sales feedback was : "The customer has never seen anything like this UI. Unfortunately, the customer sensed that the market was much bigger than anticipated and formed a study group." This was done in 2012 where smartphones were expensive.

**Name of the Product**

The product did not have any name. Now based on the character "Bhavani" from "Master", it is named after "Bhavani". Mayy he rest in peace.
