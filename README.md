**Bhavani_Tanker_Management**


The user experience of a Fleet Management (Tanker Management) web application that was developed using QooxDoo for one of the Worlds Top Truck Manufacturers. The backend used PostGIS and SHP (Shape Files).  Qooxdoo was a Python framework initially for the frontend. We also used OpenGTS. Now it is based on Javascript/TypeScript/es6. The sales feedback was : "The customer has never seen anything like this UI. Unfortunately, the customer sensed that the market was much bigger than anticipated and formed a study group." This was done in 2012 where smartphones were expensive.


**Purpose of the use case**

This use case was built for a startup to allow a centralized console to set milk collection points inside Karnataka village territory and to closely monitor all the tanker behavior. The big, hairy, audacious goal (BHAG) was to scale to the level of say a oil exploration and management console. The control was so tight that if the tanker operator dropped his spouse to work or education, he would get more salary. This was demonstrated to the Chief Operating Officer of the milk company and he was impressed that he could see the decades of his work on a computer screen. 

This is a video where Oprah gets a real look at the immortal HeLa cells as shown in the movie : "The immortal life of Henrietta Lacks". I have the book. This is the inspiration behind many visualization products.

**Name of the Product**

The product did not have any name. Now based on the character "Bhavani" from "Master", it is named after "Bhavani". May he rest in peace.
